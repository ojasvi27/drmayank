                                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
<h4><strong>Weight loss surgery is also called bariatric surgery, it is used to treat people who are dangerously obese</strong>.</h4>


<p>This type of treatment is medical treatment and surgical treatment are available to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, haven't worked.</p>
<p> Potentially life-threatening obesity is defined as: Calculate your BMI</p>
<ul>
<li>having a BMI - Body Mass Index  of 40 or above.</li> 
<li>having a BMI of 35 or above and having another serious health condition that could be improved if you lose weight, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure 
</li>


</ul>

<p>Adults who have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may also be considered for an assessment for weight loss surgery if they have a BMI of 30-34.9. </p>
<p>For people who meet the above criteria, weight loss surgery has proved to be effective in significantly and quickly reducing excess body fat. </p>

<p>However, it's always recommended that you try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased amounts of exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards


</p>
<p>Because of these associated risks, surgeon only consider someone for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not for cosmetic reasons.</p>

<h3>Availability of weight loss surgery</h3>

<p>Even if you're eligible for weight loss surgery, contact Me and take appoitnment.  Therefore, there may be a considerable waiting list.</p>
<p>Weight loss surgery is also available privately.  </p>

<ol>
<li>In form of gastric banding </li>
<li>In form gastric bypass surgery</li> 
</ol>
<p>An increasing number of people are seeking treatment in India, as costs for private treatment are often cheaper in India and best treatment is avaiable, Dr Mayank is having great experience for bariatric surgery and know as one of the best Surgeon for same.<

<h3>Types of weight loss surgery</h3>

The three most widely used types of weight loss surgery are:
<ul>
<li>Gastric band – where a band is used to reduce the stomach's size, so a smaller amount of food is required to make you feel full</li> 
<li>Gastric bypass – where your digestive system is re-routed past most of your stomach, so you digest less food and it takes much less to make you feel full</li> 
<li>Sleeve gastrectomy – where some of the stomach is removed to reduce the amount of food that's required to make you feel full</li>
</ul>

<h3>Life after weight loss surgery</h3>
<p>Weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results in terms of the amount of weight lost, but it shouldn't be seen as a magic cure for obesity</p>
<p>Weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results in terms of the amount of weight lost, but it shouldn't be seen as a magic cure for obesity</p>

This plan will include:

<ul>
<li> carefully controlled diet </li>
<li>regular exercise </li>

</ul>




<p>The rapid weight loss may cause relationship problems – for example, with a partner who is also obese – and it may lead to unwanted loose folds of skin, which may need further surgery to correct.
Many people with mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, find that these problems do not automatically improve because they have lost weight. </p>
It's important to have realistic expectations about what life after weight loss surgery will be like.
Read more about life after weight loss surgery.
<h3>Risks</h3>
As with all types of surgery, weight loss surgery carries the risk of complications, some of which are serious and potentially fatal, such as:
<ul>
<li>internal bleeding </li>
<li>a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis)</li> 

<li>a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism) </li>
<p>The overall risk of death in hospital after having any kind of weight loss surgery is around 1 in 1,000. Certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure or a BMI of 50 or above, also increase the risk of complications.</p>
Read more about the risks of weight loss surgery.
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>As long as a person is willing and able to stick to their agreed plan afterwards, surgery can effectively reduce their weight and treat conditions associated with obesity, such as diabetes.</p> 
Recent research carried out in America found that, on average:
<ul>
	<li>people with a gastric band will lose around half their excess body weight </li>
<li>people with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight </li>
</ul>
<p>Both techniques also lead to a considerable improvement (and sometimes a complete cure) of obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. 
<p>Read more about the results of weight loss surgery.</p>
How weight loss surgery is performed 
<p>The three most widely used types of weight loss surgery are gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy, both based on restriction, and gastric bypass, which uses a combination of restriction and malabsorption.
These operations are usually performed as a type of laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery, where a series of small incisions are made in the abdomen, rather than one large incision. The advantage of this type of surgery is it causes less pain afterwards and has a faster recovery time.
However, laparoscopic surgery may not always be possible in severely morbidly obese people, or those who have had other abdominal operations.
They are carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during surgery and won't feel any pain.</p>
<p>The surgeon makes the incisions in your abdomen, then inserts an instrument known as a laparoscope through one of the cuts. A laparoscope is a thin, rigid tube containing a light source and a camera. The camera relays images of the inside of your abdomen to a television monitor.
Each type of surgery is discussed in more detail below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the different weight loss operations, allowing you to compare your treatment options.</p>
<h3>Gastric banding</h3>
<p>Other small instruments are placed through the cuts to place a gastric band around the top of your stomach, effectively dividing your stomach into two, leaving a small pouch at the top.</p>
As it takes less food to fill the pouch, it takes less food to make you feel full.
The band is connected to an access port, which is placed under the skin. Saline (sterile salt water) can be passed through this port to inflate the band. This allows the band to be adjusted as required after surgery.
The surgery usually takes around an hour to complete.
<h3>Gastric bypass</h3>
<p>Gastric bypass uses special surgical staplers to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This pouch is then connected directly to a section of your small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel.</p>
This means it takes less food to make you feel full and you'll also absorb fewer calories from the food you eat.
<h3>Sleeve gastrectomy</h3>
<p>During a sleeve gastrectomy, part of the stomach is removed. This restricts the amount of food that can be eaten and results in you feeling full sooner than normal when eating.</p> 
Bypass, banding or sleeve?
<p>All three types of surgery have advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<p>There's usually more weight loss after a gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy than after a gastric band.</p>
<p>Most people with a gastric band lose around half their excess body weight, whereas most people with a gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight.</p>
<p>However, because it's more technically demanding, a gastric bypass carries a higher risk of complications, including death. Read about the risks of weight loss surgery.</p>
<p>A gastric band is reversible, so if you find it difficult to cope with the restrictions associated with life after surgery, you can have the band removed.</p>
<p>A gastric bypass or a sleeve gastrectomy, on the other hand, can't be reversed. You'll also be required to take nutritional supplements for the rest of your life if you have a gastric bypass.</p>
<p>A gastric bypass often has a much greater impact on type 2 diabetes, in a shorter time, than either a gastric band or sleeve gastrectomy.</p>
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your surgical team.
<h3>Other types of bariatric surgery</h3>
Other types of weight loss surgery, which are less commonly used, are outlined below.
<h4>Bilo-pancreatic diversion</h4>
<p>A bilo-pancreatic diversion is similar to a gastric bypass, except a much larger section of the small intestine is bypassed, meaning you'll absorb even fewer calories from the food you eat.</p>
<p>A bilo-pancreatic diversion can achieve a good level of weight loss (up to 80% of excess body weight) but it carries a high risk of complications and can cause unpleasant side effects, such as unpleasant-smelling diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Because of this, a bilo-pancreatic diversion is usually only recommended when it's felt that rapid weight loss is required to prevent a serious health condition, such as heart disease, from getting worse.
<h3>Intra-gastric balloon</h3>
<p>An intra-gastric balloon is a soft silicone balloon that's surgically implanted into your stomach. The balloon is filled with air or saline solution (sterile salt water), and so takes up some of the space in your stomach. This means you don't need to eat as much before you feel full.</p>
<p>This procedure is only temporary, and the balloon is usually removed after six months. The procedure is useful if you don't meet the criteria for the other types of surgery – for example, because you're too obese.</p>
<p>An intra-gastric balloon procedure can usually be done without making an incision in your abdomen. Instead, the balloon can be passed through your mouth and down into your stomach using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and a camera on one end). </p>
Read more information about a gastroscopy.
<h3>Risks of weight loss surgery </h3>
The rapid weight loss associated with weight loss surgery can cause a number of side effects and has a number of risks. 
These are outlined below.
Complications immediately after surgery
<p>Complications that can occur during or immediately after surgery include:</p>
<ul>
<li>infection – this affects around 1 in 20 people </li>
<li>blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism) – this affects around 1 in 100 people </li>
<li>internal bleeding – this affects around 1 in 100 people </li>
</ul>

<h3>Excess skin</h3>
<p>While weight loss surgery can successfully remove the fat in the body, it can't cause skin to revert to its pre-obesity tightness and firmness.</p>
Therefore, if you were obese, especially for many years, you may be left with excess folds and rolls of skin, particularly around the breasts, tummy, hips and limbs.
These folds and rolls normally become most apparent 12-18 months after surgery. They can look ugly and are difficult to keep clean, so you may be vulnerable to developing rashes and infections.
Cosmetic surgery can be used to remove the excess skin. However, as this treatment is for cosmetic and not clinical reasons, it's not available on the NHS. 
<h3>Gallstones</h3>
Around 1 in 12 people develop gallstones after weight loss surgery, typically 10 months after surgery.
Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. 
In most cases, gallstones don't cause any symptoms. However, if they become trapped in a duct (an opening or channel), they can irritate and inflame the gallbladder and cause symptoms, such as:
	<ul>
    <li>a sudden intense pain in your abdomen (tummy) </li>
	<li>nausea and vomiting </li>
<li>jaundice </li>
</ul>
<h3>Psychosocial effects of surgery</h3>
<p>While most people who undergo weight loss surgery report an improvement in their quality of life, several psychosocial effects may be related to rapid weight loss.</p>
<p>Some people have reported relationship problems with their partner as their partner begins to feel nervous, anxious or possibly jealous about their weight loss.</p>
<p>Social occasions that revolve around food, such as family meals, can become awkward, as it's common to feel self-conscious about your reduced capacity to eat.</p>  
<p>It's also common for a person to experience a worsening of mood when their weight stabilises, typically two years after surgery. This is often because many people realise that problems that existed before surgery, such as money worries or difficulties at work, are still there.</p>
Read more information and tips for dealing with psychosocial effects of surgery, such as stress, anxiety or depression. 
<h3>Stomal stenosis</h3>
<p>A common complication in people with a gastric bypass is that the hole (stoma) connecting their stomach pouch to their small intestine becomes narrowed and may get blocked by a piece of food. This is known as stomal stenosis and is thought to occur in one-fifth of people with a gastric bypass.</p>
The most common symptom of stomal stenosis is persistent vomiting.
Stomal stenosis can be treated by directing a small flexible tube, known as an endoscope, to the site of the stoma. A balloon attached to the endoscope is inflated to unblock the stoma.
The best way to prevent stomal stenosis is to always cut food into small chunks, chew the chunks thoroughly and avoid drinking during meals. Read more about life after weight loss surgery. 
Gastric band slippage
Gastric band slippage is a complication affecting around 1 in 50 people with a gastric band.
As the name suggests, the band slips out of position. This means the stomach pouch becomes bigger than it should be. This can cause symptoms such as:
<ul>
<li>heartburn</li> 
<li>nausea</li> 
<li>	vomiting</li>
</ul> 
Further surgery will be required to repair the band.
<h3>Food intolerance</h3>
<p>Around 1 in 35 people with a gastric band develop a food intolerance, often many years after their surgery. </p>
<p>A food intolerance is when your body is unable to tolerate certain foods, such as red meat or green salad, resulting in a number of unpleasant symptoms, such as:</p>
	<ul>
    
    <li>nausea </li>
	<li>vomiting </li>
<li>gastro-oesophageal reflux disease  </li>
</ul>
The reason why a food intolerance can develop after surgery is unclear.
<p>In most cases, avoiding foods that trigger a reaction should improve symptoms, but if you have persistent symptoms associated with a number of different foods, it may be necessary to remove the band and replace it with a gastric bypass.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>No surgery is entirely safe and all surgical procedures carry a risk of death. However, the outlook for weight loss surgery has greatly improved with modern techniques.</p>
The risk of death in hospital after having any kind of weight loss surgery is around 1 in 1,000.
Complications of weight loss surgery that could lead to death include:
<ul>
<li>a pulmonary embolism that causes serious breathing difficulties and then death </li>
<li>internal bleeding </li>
<li>infection </li>
<li>heart attack </li>
<li>	stroke </li>
</ul>
A number of risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of death during or shortly after weight loss surgery. These are:
<ul>
<li>being over 45 years old </li>
<li>high blood pressure</li> 
<li>	having a BMI of 50 or above </li>
<li>	being male, as obese men tend to weigh more than obese women </li>
<li>having a known risk factor for a pulmonary embolism </li>
</ul>
<p>Known risk factors for a pulmonary embolism include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>having a previous history of blood clots </li>
<li>pulmonary hypertension – when the blood pressure inside your lungs is particularly high </li>
<li>obesity hypoventilation syndrome – when you have persistent breathing difficulties related to your obesity </li>
The risk factors above can have a significant impact on your individual risk of death. However, untreated obesity, especially morbid obesity, carries a significant risk of premature death itself.

<p>In most cases, the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks in people who meet the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's criteria for weight loss surgery. </p>

<h3>Results of weight loss surgery </h3>
As long as you stick to the diet and exercise recommendations, all types of weight loss surgery can achieve good, and often impressive, results.
However, rapid weight loss can cause complications. Read more about the risks of weight loss surgery.
Gastric band
A person with a gastric band should expect to lose 50% of their excess body weight within two years.
<p>The weight loss is a gradual process, with:</p>
	<ul>
   <li> 35% of excess weight lost within six months of surgery</li> 
<li>40% of excess weight lost by 12 months </li>
<li>50% of excess weight lost by 24 months </li>
</ul>
<p>Expect to see a marked improvement in health conditions related to obesity, particularly:</p>
<p>type 2 diabetes  </p>
<ul>
<li>gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)</li>  
<li>obstructive sleep apnoea  </li>
<li>high cholesterol </li>
</ul>
 
<p>Most people also report an improvement in their overall quality of life, in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>day-to-day pain and discomfort</li> 
<li>general physical health </li>
<li>mental health </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gastric bypass</h3>
<p>A person with a gastric bypass should expect to lose 70% of their excess body weight within two years.</p>
<p>The weight loss tends to be more rapid in the first year (60% of the excess weight lost) then slows in the second year, with only an additional 10% weight loss.
Again, expect to see a marked improvement in the health conditions above</p>
